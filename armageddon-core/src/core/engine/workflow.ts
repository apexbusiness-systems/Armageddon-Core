// This file has been removed as part of the workflow unification.
// The canonical workflow implementation is now in src/temporal/workflows.ts
// which contains the complete ArmageddonLevel7Workflow with all 13 batteries.
//
// The engine workflow was redundant and caused potential runtime collisions
// when both workflows were registered. All workflow logic is now centralized
// in the temporal directory for consistency with the worker registration.
