Armageddon Test Suite Certification (ATSC) — armageddon.icu
Executive result

Armageddon is positioned as a sandboxed, adversarial certification for AI/agentic systems and modern software stacks—designed to break systems safely, generate evidence, and reduce enterprise risk in an era of surging GenAI spend and expanding attack surface. Worldwide GenAI spending is forecast at $644B in 2025 and information security spending at $213B in 2025—enterprises are investing heavily while demanding predictable implementation value and defensible security controls.

1) Market reality (accountable facts that justify the category)
1.1 The risk backdrop is getting worse, not better

The global average cost of a data breach reached $4.88M in 2024 (IBM/Ponemon), with 70% reporting significant disruption.

Verizon’s DBIR analyzed 10,626 confirmed breaches (2023 data) and reported vulnerability exploitation surged ~180%; ransomware/extortion techniques featured heavily.

1.2 GenAI is driving spend—and new classes of failure

Gartner forecasts $644B worldwide GenAI spending in 2025 (+76% YoY).

Gartner forecasts $213B worldwide end-user information security spend in 2025, rising to $240B in 2026.

OWASP’s Top 10 for LLM Applications lists Prompt Injection as #1 and flags “Insecure Output Handling” and “Excessive Agency” as major risks—exactly the failure modes of tool-using agents.

1.3 Regulation is converging on “prove governance,” not “promise governance”

The EU AI Act entered into force Aug 1, 2024 and rolls obligations in phases (e.g., early provisions apply from Feb 2, 2025, with broader applicability later).

NIST’s AI RMF (and its GenAI Profile) provides a governance + risk framework enterprises can operationalize with evidence.

Category implication: Enterprises need a way to demonstrate system resilience and safety controls under adversarial pressure—repeatably—without endangering production.

2) Category design: what ATSC is (and isn’t)
Category name (ownable)

Sandboxed Adversarial Certification for AI & Software Systems
(“Destruction-grade testing, evidence-based certification.”)

What it is

A standardized, repeatable certification run that:

launches concurrent batteries (chaos + security + agent-injection + workflow integrity + runtime readiness),

attempts to break the system in a sandbox, and

outputs a professional evidence bundle (reports, artifacts, logs, timelines, outcomes).

What it is not (compliance-safe)

Not “SOC 2 certified,” “ISO certified,” or a substitute for penetration testing.

Not a warranty/guarantee of breach prevention.

Not permitted to run destructively against production systems.

3) Product packaging (sellable, scalable)
Tiers (Fortune 500-friendly)

Self-Serve (Product-led wedge)

Run in DRY/sandbox; generates report + evidence artifacts.

Goal: widespread adoption by engineering teams.

Verified (Enterprise value unlock)

APEX reviews artifacts, validates the run, issues a Verified report.

Includes remediation prioritization + re-test loop.

Certified (Board/Procurement-ready)

Signed certificate + certification ID + re-test schedule.

Optional add-ons: multi-region runs, language packs, integration packs, executive readout.

“What buyers actually buy”

Reduction of launch risk

Vendor due diligence artifact

Procurement acceleration (security questionnaire compression)

Engineering clarity (“exactly what failed, why, and how to rerun”)

4) Positioning & differentiation (“why we win”)
Primary positioning statement

Armageddon Test Suite Certification proves your system remains secure and correct under worst-case conditions—by trying to break it safely in sandbox and producing evidence you can stand behind.

Differentiation vs. adjacent tools

Not just scanners (SAST/DAST/SCA): Armageddon validates runtime behavior under stress + agent failure modes, aligned to OWASP LLM risks.

Not just chaos engineering: Armageddon includes adversarial agent/prompt pathways and produces a certification-grade artifact bundle.

Not just “AI red teaming”: Armageddon is repeatable and automated, designed for CI cadence and procurement evidence.

Proof points you can cite in-market

IBM’s breach cost and operational disruption figures justify why “evidence-first resilience” matters.

Verizon’s breach volume + vulnerability exploitation surge justifies “assume failure” testing.

OWASP LLM Top 10 justifies dedicated defenses for injection/output/agency.

5) ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) & segmentation
ICP 1 — AI product companies with tool-using agents

LLM apps with plugins/tools/actions (high OWASP LLM exposure)

Buying centers: CTO, CISO, Head of Platform, VP Eng

ICP 2 — Enterprises deploying GenAI internally (high scrutiny)

Financial services, healthcare, SaaS, retail, critical infrastructure

Buying centers: Security + Risk + Procurement + AppSec

ICP 3 — “Vibe coding at scale” orgs (fast dev, high defect risk)

Teams shipping large volumes of AI-generated code (verification gap)

Buying centers: Engineering productivity + AppSec

6) Brand & messaging system (two tones, same compliant truth)
Brand voice rules (to stay mass-appeal + compliant)

Lead with sandbox safety before “destroy your system”

Speak in outcomes + evidence artifacts, not bravado

Never claim compliance certifications; claim “evidence aligned to frameworks”

Message house (core)

Hook: “Are you Armageddoned? Run the test. See what happens.”

Promise: “Sandboxed adversarial certification with receipts.”

Proof: “Artifacts, timelines, logs, rerun instructions.”

CTA: “Run DRY in minutes; upgrade to Verified/Certified.”

Legal-safe boilerplate line (everywhere)

“Armageddon is designed for controlled sandbox testing and does not guarantee breach prevention. Certification reflects results of the tested build/configuration at time of run.”

7) Go-to-market motions (Fortune 500 playbook)
7.1 Product-led growth (wedge)

Free DRY run that generates:

a short “risk radar” scorecard,

one-click shareable report link (expiring),

and a “next best action” remediation list.

Goal: internal champions + organic expansion.

12) 1-page “narrative” for leadership

Enterprises are increasing GenAI investment while threats and governance expectations rise. Breach costs remain material (IBM: $4.88M avg in 2024) and breach volumes and vulnerability exploitation trends remain high (Verizon DBIR).
OWASP identifies prompt injection and excessive agency as top risks for LLM applications; NIST provides a governance framework for trustworthy AI.
Armageddon Test Suite Certification fills the gap: sandboxed adversarial certification that produces decision-grade evidence. It helps engineering ship with confidence and helps security/procurement buy with confidence—without pretending to be a compliance certification.
